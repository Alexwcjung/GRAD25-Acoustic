üå≥ This study aims to investigate whether Korean learners of English can accurately perceive and distinguish the vowels / ä/, /u/, and /o/, which represent subtle contrasts not present in the Korean vowel system. Since these distinctions do not exist in Korean, learners may fail to discriminate them at the perceptual level, which could lead to phonetic substitutions during production. By examining learners‚Äô perceptual accuracy, the study seeks to determine whether perceptual difficulty is a key factor contributing to substitution errors in speech.

- RQ1. To what extent is the English vowel / ä/ substituted with /u/ or /o/ in the speech of Korean learners, and which substitution pattern is most frequent?
- RQ2. To what extent can Korean learners perceptually discriminate between the vowels / ä/, /u/, and /o/ in English?
- RQ3. Is there a statistically significant relationship between Korean learners‚Äô perceptual discrimination ability and their production accuracy of / ä/?

Step 1. Production Task
- Participants were asked to read aloud 5 to 6 sentences, each containing a target word with the vowel / ä/ (e.g., book, foot, good, could, would). The sentences were constructed in natural, everyday language to minimize any awareness of the specific phonetic target.

üçÄ Example sentence: I would like to buy the book now.

+ To prevent participants from focusing on the target vowel, the task was presented as a simple reading activity, without any mention of the research objective or the presence of / ä/ in the word list. This was done to ensure that their pronunciation reflected their habitual speech patterns rather than being influenced by experimental awareness.

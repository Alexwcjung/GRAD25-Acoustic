ðŸŒ³ This study aims to investigate whether Korean learners of English can accurately perceive and distinguish the vowels /ÊŠ/, /u/, and /o/, which represent subtle contrasts not present in the Korean vowel system. Since these distinctions do not exist in Korean, learners may fail to discriminate them at the perceptual level, which could lead to phonetic substitutions during production. By examining learnersâ€™ perceptual accuracy, the study seeks to determine whether perceptual difficulty is a key factor contributing to substitution errors in speech.

- RQ1. To what extent is the English vowel /ÊŠ/ substituted with /u/ or /o/ in the speech of Korean learners, and which substitution pattern is most frequent?
- RQ2. To what extent can Korean learners perceptually discriminate between the vowels /ÊŠ/, /u/, and /o/ in English?
- RQ3. Is there a statistically significant relationship between Korean learnersâ€™ perceptual discrimination ability and their production accuracy of /ÊŠ/?

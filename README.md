# Research Overview

This study aims to investigate whether Korean learners of English can accurately perceive and distinguish the vowels **/ʊ/**, **/u/**, and **/o/**, which represent subtle contrasts not present in the Korean vowel system. Since these distinctions do not exist in Korean, learners may fail to discriminate them at the perceptual level, which could lead to phonetic substitutions during production. By examining learners’ perceptual accuracy, the study seeks to determine whether perceptual difficulty is a key factor contributing to substitution errors in speech.

## Research Questions

**Q1.** To what extent is the English vowel **/ʊ/** substituted with **/u/** or **/o/** in the speech of Korean learners, and which substitution pattern is most frequent?

**Q2.** To what extent can Korean learners perceptually discriminate between the vowels **/ʊ/**, **/u/**, and **/o/** in English?

**Q3.** Is there a statistically significant relationship between Korean learners’ perceptual discrimination ability and their production accuracy of **/ʊ/**?

## Step 1. Production Task

1. Ask participants to record 5–6 sentences containing target words with the vowel **/ʊ/**.  
   Example target words: *book*, *foot*, *good*, *could*, *would*  
   Example sentence:  
   > *I would like to buy the book now.*

2. Present the task as a **simple reading activity**.  
   - Do **not** inform participants of the experiment's actual purpose.  
   - Ensure that participants are **not aware** that the sentences include specific vowel targets.

3. Measure formant values of the target vowel using **Praat**.  
   - Use native-speaker vowel values as reference.
   - Measure **F1** and **F2** of each vowel token.

### Expected Formant Characteristics

| Vowel | F1 (Height) | F2 (Backness) | Notes |
|-------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| /ʊ/   | Medium       | Medium–Low      | Short, lax vowel |
| /u/   | Low          | Low             | Long, tense vowel |
| /o/   | Medium       | Higher than /u/ | Often realized as diphthong /oʊ/ |

# Research Overview

This study aims to investigate whether Korean learners of English can accurately perceive and distinguish the vowels **/ʊ/**, **/u/**, and **/o/**, which represent subtle contrasts not present in the Korean vowel system. Since these distinctions do not exist in Korean, learners may fail to discriminate them at the perceptual level, which could lead to phonetic substitutions during production. By examining learners’ perceptual accuracy, the study seeks to determine whether perceptual difficulty is a key factor contributing to substitution errors in speech.

## Research Questions

**Q1.** To what extent is the English vowel **/ʊ/** substituted with **/u/** or **/o/** in the speech of Korean learners, and which substitution pattern is most frequent?

**Q2.** To what extent can Korean learners perceptually discriminate between the vowels **/ʊ/**, **/u/**, and **/o/** in English?

**Q3.** Is there a statistically significant relationship between Korean learners’ perceptual discrimination ability and their production accuracy of **/ʊ/**?

## Step 1. Production Task

### 1.1. Task Procedure

Participants were asked to read aloud 5 to 6 sentences containing target words with the vowel **/ʊ/**.  
Example target words: *book*, *foot*, *good*, *could*, *would*

> **Example sentence**:  
> *I would like to buy the book now.*

To prevent task awareness effects, the production task was introduced as a simple reading activity. Participants were **not informed** of the experimental focus on /ʊ/, and the presence of target words was not disclosed.

### 1.2. Acoustic Analysis

Recordings were segmented and analyzed using **Praat**. For each target word, the vowel segment was isolated, and the first and second formants (**F1** and **F2**) were measured at the midpoint of the vowel duration.

**Reference values** (based on native speaker data) were used to compare learner production.

| Vowel | F1 (Height) | F2 (Backness) | Notes |
|-------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| /ʊ/   | Medium       | Medium–Low      | Short, lax vowel |
| /u/   | Low          | Low             | Long, tense vowel |
| /o/   | Medium       | Higher than /u/ | Often diphthongized (e.g., /oʊ/) |

### 1.3. Statistical Analysis

#### A. Descriptive Statistics

**Objective**: To examine the frequency with which /ʊ/ was substituted in learner speech.

| Realized As | Frequency |
|-------------|-----------|
| **[ʊ]**      | 160       |
| **[u]**      | 90        |
| **[o]**      | 50        |

#### B. Inferential Statistics

##### (1) Chi-Square Test

**Purpose**  
To test whether the distribution of substituted vowels ([ʊ], [u], [o]) is statistically different.

- **H₀ (Null Hypothesis)**: There is **no significant difference** in substitution frequency.
- **H₁ (Alternative Hypothesis)**: One or more substitutions occur **significantly more frequently** than others.

**Interpretation Example**  
> "Learners substituted [u] significantly more often than [ʊ] itself when attempting to produce /ʊ/."  
> → Suggests a clear **mispronunciation trend**.

##### (2) Formant Comparison (One-Way ANOVA)

**Purpose**  
To determine whether the formant values (F1, F2) of realized vowels **[ʊ]**, **[u]**, and **[o]** differ significantly.

- **Dependent Variable**: F1 or F2
- **Independent Variable**: Realized vowel category ([ʊ], [u], [o])
- **Method**: One-Way ANOVA

**Interpretation Example**  
> "F2 values showed that [ʊ] and [u] were significantly different (p < .05), but [ʊ] and [o] were not."  
> → Indicates that learners **do not clearly distinguish [ʊ] and [o]** acoustically in their production.
